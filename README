swift: the multiparty transport protocol
    (aka BitTorrent at the transport layer)
    Differently from TCP, the protocol does not use the ordered data stream
    abstraction. Effectively, it splits a file into 1KB packets and sends
    them around. The secret sauce is Merkle hash trees and binmaps.
 
    Requires libevent-2.0 or higher.

see doc/index.html for marketing stuff, ideas and rants
    doc/draft-ietf-ppsp-grishchenko-swift.txt for protocol draft spec
    *.cpp for the actual code
    swift.cpp is the main exec file; may run as e.g.
    
        ./swift -t node300.das2.ewi.tudelft.nl:20000 -h \
        d1502706c46779d361a1d562a10da0a45c4c40e5 -f \
        trailer.ogg
        
    ...to retrieve video and save it to a file.

    Alternatively, you might play with the HTTP gateway, the preliminary
    version. First, run the seeder-tracker: 

        $ ./swift -f ~/Downloads/big_buck_bunny_480p_stereo.ogg -l 0.0.0.0:20000
        Root hash: 7c462ad1d980ba44ab4b819e29004eb0bf6e6d5f

    ...then you may try running the swift-HTTP gateway...

        $ ./swift -t 127.0.0.1:20000 -g 0.0.0.0:8080 -w

    ...and finally you may point your browser at the gateway...

        http://127.0.0.1:8080/7c462ad1d980ba44ab4b819e29004eb0bf6e6d5f

    If you use an HTML5 browser (Chrome preferred), you are likely to see
    the bunny trailer at this point...
